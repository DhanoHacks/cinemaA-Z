For sure it strikes a nerve in persons of my generation. This is Bob Clark's masterpiece and I know I am not the only person who feels this way. I am going to assume that, if you are reading this, chances are you have seen the film; indeed, probably have seen it countless times as I have. This is not a film review in the normal sense. It is more a reminiscence and appreciation of a great story captured for all time in moving pictures which, in turn, captured the essence of the time and place of its setting; that time and setting being a typical town in Indiana during Christmas season in the 1940s as we observe a typical family (the Parkers) with two young sons named Ralphie and Randy. Most of us over the age of 50 can relate very well to the story's key elements. I recall vividly family outings to crowded downtown sidewalks, Mom and Dad squeezing in a season's worth of shopping in one day and doing it under the nose of one who had a visit to Santa Claus on his mind. Staring at the prominent HIGBEES sign in the downtown square, I could almost see the words John A. Brown in its place. Browns was the main department store in my hometown of Oklahoma City and the place where I would make my annual visit with Santa Claus.I am sure most who have seen the film realize this is Ralphie's story, but Melinda Dillon as the typical 1940's stay-at-home mom and Darren McGavin as the grumpy but kindly father made the story work. The stove in the Parker's kitchen reminds much of the one my grandmother had, and the rest of the house reminded me of the home my other grandparents lived in. As you see, viewing A Christmas Story is always a magical experience for me. It is almost as if Mr. Clark made this film with Tom Fowler in mind. There are so many comments to make. It will be impossible to relate them all in a short review, but here are some that I know people my age will be most familiar with:Beautiful toys displayed in department store windows. The agonizingly long wait for toys ordered via mail and learning too late they are not quite what was expected. The excitement of buying a Christmas tree, the joy of setting it up and how much bigger Christmas trees seemed then. Neighborhood bullies who were not nearly as tough as they seemed. Ralphie wanting a BB gun more than life itself. Mom covering trouble for Ralphie to his dad, and the same mom making him eat soap for uttering words -- learned from Dad. Randy sitting underneath the kitchen sink when depressed. A panicky visit to a tired Santa. An unwanted gift from a well-meaning aunt. The furious unwrapping of gifts on Christmas morning. I could go on and on. I will make two more observations and then will sign off and let somebody else speak.In the film's sweetest scene, we see Dad coming through for his son at the last possible moment. To see the look on young Ralphie's (ably played by Peter Billingsley) face as he unwraps his best and last gift is one of filmdom's true golden moments. But, for me the best moment was the last. Ralphie is in bed at film's end. We see snow outside and Ralphie dreaming of his wonderful gift, as the story's author and narrator Jean Shepherd, speaking as the grown up Ralphie, realizes this was the best Christmas he ever had, or ever would have.If you are middle age or older and have not seen A Christmas Story, you are perhaps unaware that you have cheated yourself. Buy or rent the 2003 20th anniversary DVD. It will be the best money you spend this Christmas -- or any Christmas."", ""A Christmas Story, there is absolutely no way that anyone could ever say they never saw this film since it's shown every Christmas, especially on TNT when they do the 24 hours of A Christmas Story, lol. But onto the movie, I've watched A Christmas Story since the day I was born, it's one of those films you never get sick of because of the simple fact that each year of your life you could relate to it in some way. Each character has these memorable moments and you could say that you've been in the same situation. It's great seeing this movie because it makes us laugh about the silliest moments in our life during the Christmas season.Ralphie is a little boy who just so badly wants a B.B. gun for Christmas, it's just his dream. Only one problem, it'll shoot his eye out according to the adults around him. We go through Christmas with Ralphie and his family, his father who is obsessed with a prize leg lamp he won. His mother who is greatly under-appreciated but extremely loving. His brother, Randy, who is your typical silly and annoying younger brother who makes fun of him. And his friends who are on a constant run from the school bully. But all Ralphie can think about during this hard time in his adolescence is that B.B. gun.A Christmas Story has constant unforgettable scenes, like the pink bunny out fit that Ralphie gets as a present from his aunt, him saying his first swear in front of his dad, Mom and Dad's fight over using the glue on purpose, visiting Santa at the mall, and of course that great ending that is sure to bring a that is sure to bring a tear to your eye. It's just the perfect Christmas movie that is a BIG recommendation for the season. It has great comedy, terrific acting, and just the most touching moments you'll ever see in a Christmas movie.10/10"", 'Nostalgic tale of a Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) growing up in the 1940s (I believe). He wants nothing more than a Red Ryder Ranger Model Air Rifle (a BB gun for short) for Christmas but everyone tells him it will ""shoot your eye out"".That\'s about it for plot but the film has sequences that every child (and adult) can relate to. My favorites: Ralphie\'s best friend getting his tongue stuck to a pole when he\'s dared to lick it; Ralphie accidentally swearing in front of his father; the bully that threatens Ralphie and his friends every day until Ralphie beats him up (in a GREAT scene); Ralphie\'s constant fights with his little brother (wonderfully played by Ian Petrella) and Billingsley and his brother being terrified by a department store Santa.Also Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin are just great as the parents-- especially Dillon. She has one uproarious scene where she gets Petrella to eat by imitating a pig! This was totally ignored when it came out in 1983 but has slowly developed a cult following. It\'s now considered one of the best Christmas movies ever made--right up there with ""It\'s a Wonderful Life"" (which was also ignored at its release).A charming, wonderful Christmas film. A 10 all the way!', 'Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants a Red Rider BB Gun for Christmas but his mother is totally against it - the ""you\'ll shoot your eye out"" discussion being a major opposition.This is essentially a story about childhood and is very spot-on in regards to the yearning of children and the whole Christmas era - I\'ve been watching it since I was a child and every Christmas when it comes on TV I watch it again. It\'s funny, poignant and totally memorable - it has some of the best scenes of all-time and although I know a few people who dislike it because it\'s a bit ""weird"" and ""dark,"" most people I know love it.Worth watching every Christmas, forever!', 'Obviously, there have been some serious typos, miscalculations and misunderstandings. A 7.9 rating for one of the greatest movies of all time? One of the greatest Christmas movies EVER?!?', ""Maybe because I came to this as an adult, but I found it awful, lame acting, poor kid acting, and slapstick; I have tried to watch this on three separate occasions over the past Christmases, but I can't get past the first 40 minutes. I love the setting; I have my favourite Christmas films, One Magic Christmas, Its a wonderful life, the original Prancer, most of the Polar Express, both the Miracle on 4 st, recently Mel Gibson's Fatman and a few more. I have to reach another 131 words, OK. I can't put my finger on why I find the film so unamusing, but I gave it another try as a sequel has now arrived; I am very much in the minority on this one; I think I should have seen it when a child, rose-tinted glasses etc."", 'Christmas is coming up and everyone loves Christmas. Its the most profitable holiday in history. Last year I watched a film that was considered a Classic Holiday Movie.Well, This ""Classic"" is supposed to be about a kid who wants a Red Rider Gun for Christmas but people like the parents and teacher and even the Mall Santa say he will shoot his eye out. You can see where this is going very fast in A Christmas Story. One of the worst, if not the worst Christmas film I have ever seen.I cannot believe people call this a ""Classic"" as this movie is so terrible I actually felt like burning this movie in a fireplace. It makes me so mad that I feel people who like this movie should get coal in their stockings.The movie goes from being absolutely ridiculous and plain scary with its bad cinematography to having the most offensive message in A Christmas movie ever. Ill get to that later. But for now, let me tell you whats wrong with this movie.First off, I can\'t stand the narrator of this movie. I don\'t care if this is a ""True Story"" about him I just want to watch a regular Christmas film. Even if they need a narrator I would cast someone better to do the Voice Over. There is this kid named Ralphie (He is a cute kid, but being a cute kid doesn\'t mean not trying to act at all) who wants this gun for Christmas as I said before but everyone is like NO so he tries to do whatever he can to convince them.This movie must of inspired The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid movies for its mean spirited scenes like for example there is this one scene where these idiots tell this innocent kid to put his tongue on a frozen pole and it obviously gets stuck. In fact, he has to get some of it removed. This scene is so mean.Not to mention most of the characters are also cruel. I feel like the parents of this movie are going to get divorced in one scene but don\'t. There is one cruel scene where a mother forces his son to put on a bunny costume. If I were a parent I would never force my son or daughter to put something on that they don\'t like. I would just take it back to the store and get a refund.Even in one scene, A KID SAYS HIS DAD WANTS TO KILL HIM! What kind of entertainment is this?! Kids thinking they are going to get their heads cut off organs removed!? Who wrote this? A Mad man? A Serial Killer? Are they saying that HEY KIDS YOUR PARENTS ARE GOING TO KILL YOU? This made me furious.Even The Kid Ralphie doesn\'t deserve anything for Christmas. He swears and beats up a kid and lies! But guess what? HE GETS THE FRIGGN GUN ANYWAYS! Why is this mean spirited message in this movie? If you\'re bad you get what you want? I don\'t care if this film takes place in the 1950\'s where beating up bullies were brave. This kid is a brat! He is evil! He doesn\'t deserve anything.The movie is so stupid and ridiculous. There is one scene where I thought there was going to be a leg lamp. THERE WAS! I didn\'t even look at the poster or what happened! I just guessed it and my prediction was right! Leg Lamps? Mean Santa Claus? Parents Putting Soap In Their Mouthes? THIS IS COMPLETELY DUMB! Even my Mom Agrees with me that this movie is very bad. This is a warning to all Christmas Movie fans out there. If you are going to watch good holiday movies or specials then I suggest you watch A Charlie Brown Christmas, Garfield\'s Christmas Special, Elf and Its A Wonderful Life and Arthur Christmas. Those are movies and specials worth watching.But you know what might be worse then this movie? A SEQUEL TO THIS MOVIE! 39/100 D+', ""This movie has so many things wrong with it that it is hard to find a place to begin.The narration wasn't needed and even if it was one must find a better voice than Jean Shepherd. The voice doesn't work.I never enjoy action that is sped up, i.e., the children running, for the sake of laughs. Some people find that funny but I find it unimaginative.There is a scene where the Ralphie character is in a room with his Mother and both of their bodies are facing to the right but Ralphie is looking over his right shoulder to the left of the camera for two seconds before, presumably, someone off screen indicates to him that he should be facing forward as his Father is coming into the room.Santa and his helpers in the department store are so impatient and ill-mannered that they wouldn't be tolerated in 1940 let alone when the movie was made.I had not one laugh during this film and kept thinking I don't want to see anymore of this and that perhaps it gets better because so many people like this movie.I have to rate this as one of the worst films I've ever seen.Stick with Home Alone as it is entertaining and has some genuine laughs."", 'I just cannot understand why people seem to appreciate this movie so much. I forced myself to sit through this abomination of a movie. The script is horrible, the characters are SUPER annoying and unbelievable. Yeah, it\'s a kids\' movie, but a good kids\' movie should at the very least not irritate the brains out of adult watchers.The worst thing about the movie is the way the children are represented. They are so selfish and spoiled, they do not have a single thing good in them. Even supposedly being upper middle class, they should show at least some signs of genuine compassion towards other people, however suppressed. At least the ""bullies"" seem to care about each other.The story seems to be supposed to be a growth story, but actual character development is minimal.The movie is set in the 1940s. This is completely arbitrary and actually makes the movie less believable than it would be were it to be set in a more recent time.If you\'re going to watch this movie, at least be warned: You are going to watch an hour and a half of spoiled kids being annoying and their parents being stupid.', 'The very first time I saw this movie, I was about seven. I thought it was hilarious, but forgettable.I saw it again a few years later. It was still worth a chuckle, but it\'s not a movie that holds up to repeat viewings.Around 1999, Turner Broadcasting got hold of this movie, and had a BRILLIANT idea: ""Hey, why don\'t we air this movie twelve times in a row on Christmas?"" A more bizarre and nonsensical programming decision has never been made.And yet, here we are, in 2006, and every blasted year, they still run a 24-hour marathon of this one movie.WHY? There are literally HUNDREDS of very good Christmas movies out there. Dozens which are infinitely superior to this gormless masturbation of inane reminiscence. TBS could spend the 24 hours from Christmas Eve to Christmas dinner showing Prancer, The Santa Clause, Miracle on 34th Street, or any of a hundred other movies--and that\'s not even going into the religious films they could show. And yet, against all logic, they roll out twelve back-to-back iterations of THIS.They have effectively run this movie so far into the ground, its vaunted snow is melting from the heat of the Earth\'s core.']","['showtimes', 'vudu', 'amazon-prime-video-us', 'hbo-max', 'itunes']","[""Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio"", 'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery', 'The Menu', 'Fleishman Is in Trouble', 'The Parent Trap', 'Peter Pan', 'Big', 'Bambi', 'Matilda']",English,90,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_christmas_story_1983,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-christmas-story
